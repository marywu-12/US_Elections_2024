# 2024 General Elections Prediction
This project attempts to predict the 2024 General Election outcome using Jim Albert's Bayesian framework that can be accessed at https://learnbayes.blogspot.com/2008/10/how-many-electoral-votes-will-obama-get.html. 

The state-level polling data is available on fivethirtyeight.com: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/polls. Since Kamala Harris announced candidacy on [July 21, 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris_2024_presidential_campaign), I use 07/21/24 - 10/30/24 for the time range.
