# 2024 General Elections Prediction
This project attempts to predict the 2024 General Election outcome using Jim Albert's Bayesian framework that can be accessed at https://learnbayes.blogspot.com/2008/10/how-many-electoral-votes-will-obama-get.html. 

The state-level polling data is available on fivethirtyeight.com: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/polls. For each state, I use the most recent polling result up to 10/30/2024, i.e. the poll that has the most recent end date.
